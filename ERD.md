### Junction Tables

- **round_questions**: Many-to-many relationship between rounds and questions
- **game_players**: Many-to-many relationship between games and users (as players)
- **game_answers**: Tracks team answers for specific questions in games

## Data Flow Patterns

1. **Game Creation Flow**:
   ```
   User (host) → Game → Round(s) → Round_Questions → Questions
   ```

2. **Team Management Flow**:
   ```
   User (host) → Game → Game_Teams → Game_Players
   ```

3. **Game Play Flow**:
   ```
   Round_Question → Game_Answers (from Teams)
   ```

4. **Scoreboard Updates**:
   ```
   Game_Answers → Game.scoreboard (real-time updates)
   ```

## Game State Management

The `games.data` JSON field stores the current game state and progresses through these states:

1. **game-start**: Welcome screen with game information
2. **round-start**: Round introduction with categories
3. **round-play**: Active question answering with answer submission
4. **round-end**: Round completion with current scores
5. **game-end**: Final results and winner announcement
6. **thanks**: Post-game thank you screen
7. **return-to-lobby**: Navigation back to host dashboard

## Access Control Patterns

- **Host-based Access**: Most collections use `host.id=@request.auth.id` rules, meaning only the creator can access their own records
- **Game-based Isolation**: Records are scoped by both host and game, ensuring data isolation between different games
- **Public Read Access**: Questions collection has permissive read rules for game functionality
- **Team-based Access**: Game answers are scoped by both host and team for security

## Performance Considerations

1. **Strategic Indexing**: All foreign key fields are indexed for optimal join performance
2. **Composite Indexes**: Important query patterns have composite indexes (e.g., host+game combinations)
3. **Unique Constraints**: Game codes and external question IDs have unique constraints for data integrity
4. **JSON Fields**: Categories, metadata, game state, and scoreboard data use JSON for flexible, semi-structured data storage
5. **Real-time Updates**: Scoreboard and game state updates leverage PocketBase's real-time subscription system

## Security Notes

- All user-accessible collections implement row-level security based on the `host` field
- Game codes are 6-character alphanumeric strings for secure game joining
- Player assignments are tracked with both host and player references for audit trails
- Answer submissions are tied to specific teams and questions for integrity
- Game state transitions are managed server-side to prevent unauthorized state changes

## Recent Updates

- **Added `data` field to games collection**: Stores game state and configuration
- **Added `scoreboard` field to games collection**: Real-time scoreboard data structure
- **Created `game_answers` collection**: Tracks team answers during gameplay
- **Enhanced game state management**: Comprehensive state machine with 7 distinct states
- **Improved real-time functionality**: Live updates for scoreboard and game state changes
- **Added unique constraint to game_answers**: Prevents teams from submitting multiple answers to the same question (`game_questions_id` + `team` combination)
