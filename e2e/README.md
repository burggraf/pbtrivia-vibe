# E2E Mobile Testing Guide

This directory contains end-to-end tests specifically designed for mobile device testing, including keyboard overlay detection and visual regression testing.

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing Scope

**Pages Tested on Mobile** (player experience):
- `/` - Auth page (login/register)
- `/lobby` - Player lobby
- `/game/:id` - Gameplay page
- `/join` - QR code join flow

**Pages NOT Tested on Mobile** (desktop only - host experience):
- `/host` - Host control panel
- `/controller` - Game controller with QR code

This reflects the real-world usage where players use mobile devices and hosts use desktop/tablets.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests on all configured mobile devices
npm run test:e2e

# Run only on specific devices (iPhone 13 and Pixel 5)
npm run test:e2e:mobile

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:e2e:keyboard   # Mobile keyboard overlay tests
npm run test:e2e:visual     # Visual regression tests
npm run test:e2e:smoke      # Quick smoke tests
npm run test:e2e:player     # Player page tests (lobby, game) - requires auth setup

# Run tests with UI (great for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in headed mode (see the browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug specific test
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

## Configured Mobile Devices

Tests run on the following device configurations:

**iPhone:**
- iPhone SE (375x667) - Smallest iOS screen, good for minimum size testing
- iPhone 13 (390x844) - Standard modern iPhone
- iPhone 13 Pro Max (428x926) - Large iPhone screen

**Android:**
- Pixel 5 (393x851) - Google reference device
- Galaxy S9+ (360x740) - Samsung device

**Tablet:**
- iPad Pro (1024x1366) - Larger mobile screen testing

## Test Files

### `mobile-keyboard.spec.ts`
Tests for mobile keyboard overlay issues:
- Verifies input fields remain visible when keyboard appears
- Checks submit buttons are accessible with keyboard open
- Tests touch target sizes (minimum 44px height)
- Validates scroll-to-input behavior

### `mobile-visual.spec.ts`
Visual regression tests:
- Captures screenshots across all devices
- Tests dark mode appearance
- Validates responsive breakpoints
- Checks for content overflow
- Tests landscape orientation

### `mobile-smoke.spec.ts`
Quick smoke tests:
- Verifies core functionality on mobile
- Tests page responsiveness
- Validates text readability
- Checks performance metrics

### `mobile-game-workflows.spec.ts`
Game workflow tests (player experience only):
- Join flow via QR code
- Team selection
- Page responsiveness
- NOTE: Host and controller pages are desktop-only and excluded

### `mobile-player-pages.spec.ts`
Focused tests for player-facing pages (requires authentication):
- **Lobby page**: Game code input, join button, error handling, keyboard behavior
- **Game page**: Question display, answer buttons, scoreboard, navigation
- **Team selection modal**: Team list, team creation, modal usability
- NOTE: All tests are skipped until test credentials are configured

## Common Use Cases

### Before Pushing Code
```bash
npm run test:e2e:smoke
```
Quick check that nothing major is broken on mobile.

### After UI Changes
```bash
npm run test:e2e:visual
```
Capture visual regressions across devices.

### Testing Forms
```bash
npm run test:e2e:keyboard
```
Ensure keyboard doesn't hide input fields.

### Debugging a Specific Test
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug -- --grep "keyboard overlay"
```

## Viewing Test Results

After tests run, an HTML report is generated:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

Screenshots and traces are saved in `test-results/` directory.

## Tips

1. **Visual Tests**: First run generates baseline screenshots. Subsequent runs compare against baselines.

2. **Device Selection**: Edit `playwright.config.ts` to add/remove device configurations.

3. **Network Throttling**: Tests can be configured to simulate slow networks. See `playwright.config.ts`.

4. **CI Integration**: Tests automatically use CI-optimized settings (retry on failure, sequential execution).

## Troubleshooting

**Tests timing out?**
- Check that `./dev.sh` starts successfully
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts` webServer section

**Visual diffs failing?**
- Review screenshots in HTML report
- Update baselines: `npm run test:e2e:visual -- --update-snapshots`

**Flaky keyboard tests?**
- Keyboard animations can cause timing issues
- Tests include 300ms waits for keyboard to settle
- Consider increasing wait times if needed

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

- Tests use actual mobile viewports and user agents
- Touch events are simulated (not mouse events)
- Device pixel ratios are correctly configured
- Mobile-specific CSS is tested (@media queries)

## Enabling Authentication-Required Tests

Many tests in `mobile-player-pages.spec.ts` are currently skipped because they require authentication. To enable these tests:

### 1. Create Test User Accounts

Create test accounts in PocketBase (via admin panel at `http://localhost:8090/_/`):
- `player1@test.com` / `TestPass123!`
- `player2@test.com` / `TestPass123!`

### 2. Create Test Games (Optional)

For workflow tests, create a test game:
- Game code: `TEST01`
- Status: `ready`
- This allows testing the full join flow

### 3. Use Playwright Storage State (Recommended)

Create an auth setup script to save authentication state:

```typescript
// e2e/auth.setup.ts
import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test';

setup('authenticate as player', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Player' }).click();
  await page.getByLabel('Email').fill('player1@test.com');
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('TestPass123!');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign In' }).click();
  await page.waitForURL(/\/lobby/);
  await page.context().storageState({ path: 'e2e/.auth/player.json' });
});
```

Update `playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
projects: [
  { name: 'setup', testMatch: /.*\.setup\.ts/ },
  {
    name: 'iphone-13',
    use: {
      ...devices['iPhone 13'],
      storageState: 'e2e/.auth/player.json'
    },
    dependencies: ['setup']
  }
]
```

### 4. Remove `.skip()` from Tests

Once authentication is configured, remove `.skip()` from tests in:
- `mobile-player-pages.spec.ts`
- `mobile-game-workflows.spec.ts`

### 5. Add `.auth/` to .gitignore

```bash
echo "e2e/.auth/" >> .gitignore
```

## Next Steps

- Enable authentication-required tests by setting up test accounts
- Add tests for your specific mobile workflows
- Configure additional device types as needed
- Set up CI/CD pipeline integration
- Add network throttling tests for slow connections
