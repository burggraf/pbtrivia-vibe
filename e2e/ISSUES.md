# Mobile E2E Test Findings

This document tracks UX issues and findings discovered through mobile e2e testing.

## 📱 Mobile Testing Scope

**Pages Tested on Mobile** (Player Experience):
- `/` - Auth page (login/register)
- `/lobby` - Player lobby
- `/game/:id` - Gameplay page
- `/join` - QR code join flow

**Pages NOT Tested on Mobile** (Desktop Only - Host Experience):
- `/host` - Host control panel
- `/controller` - Game controller with QR code

This reflects real-world usage where players use mobile devices and hosts use desktop/tablets.

## 🔴 High Priority Issues

### 1. Logout Button Too Small for Touch
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: High (resolved)
**Device Impact**: All devices
**Page**: `/lobby`

**Details**:
- **Before**: Logout button was 36px height
- **After**: Logout button is now 44px height
- **Web Standard**: 40px minimum ✅
- **iOS Guideline**: 44px recommended ✅

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed button size from `size="sm"` to `size="default"`
- Added `min-h-11` class to explicitly set 44px height
- File: `src/pages/LobbyPage.tsx:140`

**User Impact (Before Fix)**:

- Below both web and iOS accessibility guidelines

**User Impact (After Fix)**:
- ✅ Meets both web standard (40px) and iOS guideline (44px)
- ✅ Easier to tap accurately on all mobile devices
- ✅ Improved accessibility

**Testing**:
- Found by: `mobile-player-pages.spec.ts` - "navigation buttons are accessible on mobile"
- Verified on: iPhone 13
- Fix Date: 2025-11-01

### 2. Touch Target Size Below iOS Guidelines (Auth Page)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: Medium (resolved)
**Device Impact**: All iOS devices
**Page**: `/` (Auth page)

**Details**:
- **Before**: Player/Host toggle buttons and Submit button were 40px height
- **After**: All buttons are now 44px height
- **iOS Guideline**: 44px minimum recommended ✅

  - Submit button: `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx:253`

**User Impact (Before Fix)**:
- Slightly harder to tap on iOS devices
- Could cause tap accuracy issues for users with larger fingers
- Below Apple's accessibility guidelines

**User Impact (After Fix)**:
- ✅ Meets iOS guideline (44px)
- ✅ Improved tap accuracy on mobile devices
- ✅ Better accessibility for all users

**Testing**:
- Found by: `mobile-keyboard.spec.ts` touch target size tests
- Verified on: iPhone SE, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro Max, Pixel 5, Galaxy S9+
- All 11 keyboard tests pass ✅
- Fix Date: 2025-11-01

**Note**: Input fields (email, password) remain at 40px height, which is acceptable for inputs per web standards. Only interactive buttons needed 44px height per iOS guidelines
