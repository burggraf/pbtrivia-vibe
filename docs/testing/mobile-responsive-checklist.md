- Optimized typography scaling for mobile readability
- Implemented responsive padding and margin spacing
- Created mobile-first layouts with progressive enhancement

## Next Steps

1. User should manually test all checklist items in browser dev tools

3. Report any layout issues or improvements needed
4. Once verified, merge to main branch

## Notes

- All lint errors (5) are pre-existing in `ControllerPage.tsx`
- All lint warnings (54) are pre-existing across the codebase
